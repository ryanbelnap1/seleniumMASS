check this app and its folders and code to tell me if i can start it with a certain streamlite run main.py command
Based on the provided files and their contents, it seems that the application can indeed be started with a Streamlit run command. The main script main.py is designed to work with Streamlit, which is a framework for building web applications in Python.

Here's a summary of the necessary steps and the command to start the application:

Step-by-Step Guide
Install Dependencies:

First, ensure all the dependencies listed in requirements.txt are installed. This can be done using the following command:
sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup Virtual Environment:

Make sure to create and activate a virtual environment as described in the setup_scraper.sh script.
sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Run Setup Script:

Run the setup_scraper.sh script to install Chrome and other necessary dependencies.
sh
chmod +x setup_scraper.sh
./setup_scraper.sh
Run Streamlit Application:

Start the Streamlit application using the main.py file.
sh
streamlit run main.py
Command to Start the Application
sh
streamlit run main.py
This command assumes that you have a correctly set up environment (e.g., Python virtual environment) and that you have installed all the required packages.

Directory Structure
The provided file paths and contents suggest the following directory structure:

Code
seleniumMASS/
├── chromedriver
├── main.py
├── parse.py
├── requirements.txt
├── scrape.py
├── setup_scraper.sh
└── START.txt
Important Notes:
Ensure that chromedriver is executable and is correctly placed within your PATH or within the same directory as your scripts.
Make sure your .env file (which is referred to in scrape.py) is correctly set up with necessary environment variables.
Follow any additional instructions in setup_scraper.sh to complete the setup.
If everything is set up correctly, running the streamlit run main.py command should start your Streamlit application, allowing you to interact with the web scraper via a web interface.

okay well my command didn't work
Let's verify the main.py and its dependencies to ensure everything is set up correctly. Here is what we need to check:

Verify the main.py file:

Ensure it has the correct Streamlit setup.
Verify that it imports the necessary modules.
Check the requirements.txt file:

Ensure all required packages are listed.
Ensure the setup script setup_scraper.sh is executed properly:

This script installs dependencies, sets up the virtual environment, and installs Chrome.
Let's start by reviewing the content of main.py to verify its correctness and then check the other files.


main.py
v1
import streamlit as st
from scrape import (
    scrape_website,
    extract_body_content,
    clean_body_content,
Dependencies (requirements.txt):
pip
streamlit 
langchain 
langchain_ollama
selenium

v1
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade installed packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Instructions in START.txt:
vim
chmod +x setup_scraper.sh
./setup_scraper.sh
Given the above, here are some steps to debug and verify:

Ensure the virtual environment is activated:

sh
source venv/bin/activate
Make sure all dependencies are installed:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application:

sh
streamlit run main.py
If the command still doesn't work, please provide any error messages or logs that appear when you try to run the Streamlit command. This will help diagnose the issue further.

The error traceback indicates that there is an issue with the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable being None when trying to create a ChromiumRemoteConnection in the scrape_website function. This environment variable is likely not being set correctly from the .env file.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Ensure the .env File Exists and is Properly Configured:

Check that the .env file exists in the repository and contains the SBR_WEBDRIVER variable.
The .env file should look something like this:
env
SBR_WEBDRIVER=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
Verify the .env File Loading:

Ensure that the dotenv library correctly loads the environment variables from the .env file in the scrape.py script.
Check the scrape_website Function:

Make sure that SBR_WEBDRIVER is being assigned correctly and is not None.
Updated scrape.py with Debugging
Below is the updated scrape.py file with added debugging to ensure that the environment variable is loaded correctly:


scrape.py
v1
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
Ensure the .env File Exists
Add a .env file to the root of your project if it does not already exist:


.env
v1
```env
SBR_WEBDRIVER=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
```
Steps to Run the Application
Activate the Virtual Environment:

sh
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure the .env File is Correctly Configured.

Run the Streamlit Application:

sh
streamlit run main.py
By following these steps and ensuring that the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable is correctly set, the Streamlit application should work without encountering the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith' error.

what is that file and what does it mean
The file you are referring to is the chromedriver binary file within the ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS repository on GitHub. Here is a brief explanation of what this file is and its purpose:

chromedriver
What is chromedriver?
chromedriver is an executable file that acts as a bridge between the Selenium WebDriver and the Google Chrome browser. It is used to automate browser interactions, allowing you to control Chrome programmatically for tasks such as web scraping, testing web applications, and more.

Purpose:
Browser Automation: chromedriver enables Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Chrome browser. It translates WebDriver commands into Chrome-specific commands.
Web Scraping: In the context of your repository, which involves web scraping using Selenium, chromedriver is crucial for launching and controlling the Chrome browser to scrape data from websites.
Testing: It is also widely used in automated testing frameworks to test web applications by simulating user interactions.
How to Use chromedriver:
Download and Place: Ensure chromedriver is placed in your project directory or a location that is included in your system's PATH.
Executable Permissions: Make sure the chromedriver file has executable permissions. On Unix-based systems, you can use:
sh
chmod +x chromedriver
Specify Path in Code: When initializing the Selenium WebDriver, specify the path to chromedriver if it is not in your PATH:
Python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
Example Usage in Your Project:
Within your project, you have a script scrape.py that utilizes chromedriver to automate the Chrome browser for web scraping tasks. Here's a snippet of how it is used:

Python
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

SBR_WEBDRIVER = os.getenv("SBR_WEBDRIVER")

def scrape_website(website):
    print("Connecting to Scraping Browser...")
    sbr_connection = ChromiumRemoteConnection(SBR_WEBDRIVER, "goog", "chrome")
    with Remote(sbr_connection, options=ChromeOptions()) as driver:
        driver.get(website)
        print("Waiting captcha to solve...")
        solve_res = driver.execute(
            "executeCdpCommand",
            {
                "cmd": "Captcha.waitForSolve",
                "params": {"detectTimeout": 10000},
            },
        )
        print("Captcha solve status:", solve_res["value"]["status"])
        print("Navigated! Scraping page content...")
        html = driver.page_source
        return html
In this code:

ChromiumRemoteConnection and Remote are used to connect to the chromedriver instance specified by the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable.
The Chrome browser is automated to navigate to a specified website, solve captchas, and scrape the web page content.
Conclusion:
The chromedriver file is a vital component for automating Chrome browser interactions using Selenium in your project. It allows you to control Chrome programmatically, enabling web scraping and automated testing tasks. Make sure it is correctly configured and accessible to ensure your scripts run smoothly.

just look through my files and fix it
It looks like the .env file is missing or not accessible, which is causing the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable to be None. This is why you are encountering the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith' error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the .env file exists and contains the correct SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable. Here is how you can do it:

1. Create or Verify the .env File
Create a .env file in the root of your repository if it does not already exist. Add the following line to set the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable:


.env
v2
```env
SBR_WEBDRIVER=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
```
2. Ensure the .env File is Loaded Correctly
Make sure the dotenv library correctly loads the environment variables from the .env file in the scrape.py script. Here is the updated scrape.py with added error handling:


scrape.py
v2
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
3. Activate the Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
Make sure to activate your virtual environment and install all dependencies:

sh
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Setup Script
Ensure the setup script is executed properly:

sh
chmod +x setup_scraper.sh
./setup_scraper.sh
5. Start the Streamlit Application
Run the Streamlit application:

sh
streamlit run main.py
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith' error and get your Streamlit application running.

okay i think i know whats goind on here 
To resolve the issue, let's ensure that the .env file is correctly set up and the main.py script is properly configured to load and use the environment variables.

1. Create or Verify the .env File

.env
v3
```env
SBR_WEBDRIVER=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
```
2. Update scrape.py to Handle Missing Environment Variables
Make sure the scrape.py script loads the environment variables correctly and handles any potential issues with missing variables:


scrape.py
v3
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
3. Ensure the Virtual Environment is Activated and Dependencies are Installed
Activate your virtual environment and install all dependencies:

sh
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Setup Script
Ensure the setup script is executed properly:

sh
chmod +x setup_scraper.sh
./setup_scraper.sh
5. Start the Streamlit Application
Run the Streamlit application:

sh
streamlit run main.py
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith' error and get your Streamlit application running. If you encounter any further issues, please provide specific error messages or logs for additional assistance.

By following these steps, you should be able to get your application running correctly.

where did you get this from and what is its purposes http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
The URL http://localhost:4444/wd/hub is typically used to refer to a Selenium Grid or Selenium Standalone Server running locally. Here's a detailed explanation:

What is Selenium?
Selenium is a suite of tools for automating web browsers. It includes components like:

Selenium WebDriver: A tool for automating web application testing, and it allows you to control a browser programmatically.
Selenium Grid: A server that allows tests to use web browser instances running on remote machines.
Purpose of http://localhost:4444/wd/hub
Local Selenium Server: When you start a Selenium Standalone Server or a Selenium Grid Hub locally, it typically listens for WebDriver requests on http://localhost:4444/wd/hub.
WebDriver Endpoint: This URL serves as the endpoint for WebDriver commands. It is used by Selenium scripts to send commands to the browser and receive responses.
Use Cases
Local Testing: Developers often run a local Selenium server to test their applications on their local machine.
Grid Setup: In a Selenium Grid setup, http://localhost:4444/wd/hub might point to the local hub, which can delegate test execution to various nodes (machines with different browsers and operating systems).
Integration with Your Project
In the context of your seleniumMASS project, this URL is being used to connect to a local instance of the Selenium server to perform web scraping tasks. The environment variable SBR_WEBDRIVER is set to this URL, allowing your scripts to send WebDriver commands to the Selenium server.

Example Usage in scrape.py
In your scrape.py, the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable is used to create a connection to the Selenium server:

Python
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

SBR_WEBDRIVER = os.getenv("SBR_WEBDRIVER")

if not SBR_WEBDRIVER:
    raise ValueError("SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable is not set. Please check your .env file.")

def scrape_website(website):
    print("Connecting to Scraping Browser...")
    sbr_connection = ChromiumRemoteConnection(SBR_WEBDRIVER, "goog", "chrome")
    with Remote(sbr_connection, options=ChromeOptions()) as driver:
        driver.get(website)
        print("Waiting captcha to solve...")
        solve_res = driver.execute(
            "executeCdpCommand",
            {
                "cmd": "Captcha.waitForSolve",
                "params": {"detectTimeout": 10000},
            },
        )
        print("Captcha solve status:", solve_res["value"]["status"])
        print("Navigated! Scraping page content...")
        html = driver.page_source
        return html
Conclusion
The URL http://localhost:4444/wd/hub is essential for connecting your scripts to a local Selenium server, allowing you to automate browser interactions for tasks like web scraping and testing. Ensure that the Selenium server is running locally when you attempt to use this URL.

what is endpoint
An endpoint in the context of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is a specific URL where a particular resource can be accessed or a specific function can be executed. In the case of GitHub's REST API, endpoints are URLs that represent various resources and actions you can perform within GitHub, such as retrieving information about repositories, commits, issues, pull requests, and more.

Examples of GitHub API Endpoints
Repository Information:

Endpoint: /repos/{owner}/{repo}
Purpose: Retrieve information about a specific repository.
Example: https://api.github.com/repos/ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS
List Issues:

Endpoint: /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues
Purpose: List issues for a specific repository.
Example: https://api.github.com/repos/ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS/issues
List Pull Requests:

Endpoint: /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls
Purpose: List pull requests for a specific repository.
Example: https://api.github.com/repos/ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS/pulls
Search Issues or Pull Requests:

Endpoint: /search/issues
Purpose: Search for issues or pull requests using a query.
Example: https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS+is:open
Get Contents of a File:

Endpoint: /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}
Purpose: Retrieve the contents of a specific file in a repository.
Example: https://api.github.com/repos/ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS/contents/README.md
Components of an Endpoint
Base URL: The common part of the URL for all endpoints. For GitHub, it is https://api.github.com.
Resource Path: The specific path that identifies the resource or action. For example, /repos/{owner}/{repo}.
Path Parameters: Variables within the URL path that are replaced with specific values. For example, {owner} and {repo} are path parameters.
Query Parameters: Additional parameters appended to the URL to refine the request. For example, ?q=repo:ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS+is:open.
Example: Listing Issues
To list open issues in the ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS repository, you would use the following endpoint:

Code
https://api.github.com/repos/ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS/issues
You can add query parameters to filter the results:

Code
https://api.github.com/repos/ryanbelnap1/seleniumMASS/issues?state=open&sort=created&direction=desc
state=open: Only return open issues.
sort=created: Sort issues by creation date.
direction=desc: Sort in descending order.
Understanding endpoints and how to use them is crucial for interacting with APIs and retrieving or manipulating data programmatically.

today I'll be showing you how to build an AI web scraper using python that's right we'll be building an application
0:06
that can scrape literally any website using AI this is super cool so let's
0:11
dive in and let me give you a quick demo of how this application works so the functionality here is pretty basic all
Install/Setup
0:17
we need to do is give it a website URL so maybe something like the metal table from the recent Olympics so let's paste
0:23
that right here we will scrape the site grab the Dom content and then we can pass a prompt to our AI that we'll be
0:30
able to grab any information from this website that we want all right so we have our Dom content here this is all
0:36
the content from the site now I can paste in a prompt like give me a table that contains all of the countries and
0:42
their metal count we can wait a second and we'll get that information so there we go we just got a table now that
0:48
contains a bunch of metal Counts from the countries that were on that website let's look at a few other examples then
0:54
dive into the code and I'll show you exactly how we build something like this so here's a more e-commerce related
0:59
example it's a website called true classic which actually has my favorite t-shirts and I'll show you how we can
1:05
scrape this now and grab all of the different T-shirts from this site so I'm just looking at the polo shirts here
1:10
I'll paste in this URL scrape the site and then we'll give it a prompt and grab that information so let's parse the
1:16
content Now using this prompt and here you go we get a result here with a few different tables containing the
1:21
different products names their price currency ratings Etc lastly let's look at a real estate example you can see
1:28
here I have a property finder website for properties into dub Marina which is a place I'm going to be moving to
1:33
shortly and if we scrape the site and give it a prompt again we can get that data and here you go we get a bunch of
1:40
different properties here with all of their relevant information all right so now that we've looked at that demo we're going to start building out the project
1:47
now in order to do this we're going to need to install a few different dependencies because we're going to be using things like streamlit for the
1:53
front end we're going to be using selenium for actually doing the web scraping and then we're going to be using Lang chain for actually calling
2:00
the AI and having the AI pars through our data so what we're going to do is set up a virtual environment here and
2:06
notice I've just opened up a new window in Visual Studio code so let's do that let's install our dependencies and then
2:12
we'll start building this project so in order to do that I'm going to say Python 3-m venv and then EnV or I can name this
2:21
anything I want in this case I'm going to name it AI now if you're on Windows you can simply replace Python 3 with
2:27
python and this should spin up a new virtual environment for you using ven V okay so let's hit enter here and now you
2:33
can see that we have a new one called AI now we need to activate that virtual environment now if you're on Mac or
2:39
Linux the command to do that will be Source the name of your virtual environment then slash bin and then
2:46
slash activate when you do this you should see that you get a prefix before your commands line uh saying the name of
2:53
the virtual environment now if you're on Windows I'm going to show two commands on screen right now that will show you
2:58
how to activate your virtual Environ environment they'll differ depending if you're using CMD or Powershell so just
3:04
type that command in activate your virtual environment and now we're going to install a few different dependencies
3:10
now all the dependencies that we need have actually put up on GitHub so I'm going to link this in the description
3:15
but go there and click on requirements.txt now requirements.txt
3:20
will contain all of the requirements that we need to install so I'm just going to copy the contents of this file
3:26
and I'm going to make a new file in my local directory here contains the same so I'm going to say
3:33
requirements.txt here and I'm going to paste all of these requirements inside
3:38
so again go to the GitHub it'll be linked in the description copy the contents of the requirements.txt file
3:44
paste them inside of a new file in your local directory and then we can install them using this file so now what we're
3:51
going to do is simply uh type pip install dasr and then requirements.txt
3:57
obviously make sure that when you're running this command you're in the same directory as this file and then go ahead
4:03
and hit enter now this will install all the dependencies that we need inside of this virtual environment so that they're
4:09
contained we're not installing them systemwide now you notice here that we're using streamlet Lang chain
4:15
selenium beautiful soup and python. EnV a few other modules as well and these
4:20
will allow us to kind of build the entire project out and I'll explain each library and why we're using it when we
4:26
get to that stage it's just easier to install all of them at once all right so all of those dependencies have been
Starting the Streamlit UI
4:31
installed so I'm going to close my terminal now and we're going to move on to the next step so the first thing I'm
4:36
going to do is create a python file called main.py here now just to quickly walk you through the steps that we're
4:42
going to follow through here the first thing that we're going to do is create a very simple streamlit user interface if
4:48
you're unfamiliar with streamlit this is a way to create really simple python web applications that just takes a few lines
4:54
of code so it's probably the easiest way to interact with things like llms which is what we're going to be using here
5:00
once we built the streamlet UI the next step is to actually grab data from the website that we want to scrape so in
5:07
order to do that we're going to use a python module known as selenium selenium allows us to automate a web browser so
5:13
we can actually navigate to a web page we can grab all of the content that's on that page and then once we have that
5:20
content we can do some filtering on it and we can pass it into an llm an llm
5:25
being something like chat GPT right or gp4 or llama 3 or whatever you want to
5:30
use and then we can use that llm to actually parse through the data and give us a meaningful response so let's start
5:37
here by building out the streamlit UI and we'll kind of build this as we go through the video so we're going to say
5:43
import streamlit as St now beneath here what we're going to do is add a title
5:49
for our website so we're going to say st. tile and this is going to be AI web
5:56
if we could type this correctly scraper and and then we're just going to put a uh kind of URL input box here so we're
6:03
going to say URL is equal to st. text input like that and then we're going to
6:08
say enter a website URL okay and this is
6:13
just going to create a very simple kind of text input box for us perfect now beneath that we're going to say if
6:21
st. button and then this button is going to be scrape site then we're going to do
6:27
something inside of here so this is as simple as it is to create a streamlet UI this makes a title this adds a text
6:34
input and then the button we can put here and we say if this button is clicked then we're just going to execute whatever code is inside of this if
6:40
statement so for now actually if we want to test that we can just say st. write and then we can write something like
6:47
scraping the website and then we can proceed to scrape the website down below so in order to run our streamlit
6:53
application the way that we do that is we type streamlet and then run and then the name of the Python file that can
6:59
contains our streamlit app in this case it's main.py again notice that I'm running this from the same directory as
7:05
my python file so I do streamlit run main.py and now it's going to spin open a web server for us and you see that we
7:12
have ai webscraper we can enter a website URL and then press scrape site
7:17
when we do that it says scraping the website if we refresh it'll just go back to that main State perfect now we can
7:24
still write code while this is running it will automatically refresh but for now I'm just going to close this with
7:29
contrl C and we're going to go on to actually do the web scraping component of this app so in order to do the web
Web Scraping with Selenium
7:35
scraping here we're going to use selenium now what I'm going to do is make a new file called scrape dopy now
7:42
this is where we'll write our scraping code just to separate it from the main file so that's a little bit easier for us to navigate so what we're going to do
7:49
is import a few selenium modules or selenium I guess classes that we need to use and then we're going to write a
7:55
function that takes a website URL and just returns all of the content from that website now as I said we're going
8:01
to use selenium to do this and then I'm going to show you how we can connect this with a service known as bright data which is actually the sponsor of this
8:08
video but don't worry we'll talk about them later on which will allow us to actually do this at scale and to get
8:13
past things like captas IP bands and other blocks that you'll commonly encounter so what I'm going to do here
8:19
is import selenium do web driver as web driver and then I'm going to say from
8:27
selenium do web driver driver and this is chrome. service we are going to import
8:35
service okay now we're going to write a simple function that will allow us to actually grab the content from a website
8:41
using selenium now again what selenium allows us to do is control our web browser we can actually do things like
8:47
click buttons and interact with text Widgets or uh you know kind of interact with the page as if a human was doing it
8:54
but in this case we're just going to use it to grab the content from a site so I'm going to make a function called
9:00
scrape website and then inside of here I'm going to put website now what I'm
9:06
going to do is just do a print statement and I'm going to say launching Chrome browser just so we know what's going on
9:12
here and I'm going to write a few different variables so the first thing I'm going to do is say Chrome driver
9:18
path is equal to an empty string I am then going to specify some options Now
9:23
options is going to be web driver. Chrome options we need this when
9:29
we set up the web driver even though it's empty we still need to pass it and we could specify options here later on
9:35
and then I'm going to say driver is equal to web driver. Chrome and we're going to say
9:41
service is equal to service and we're going to pass inside of the service our Chrome driver path we're then going to
9:47
say options is equal to options so let's save that and I'll just make this a bit
9:53
bigger so we can see and let's write the rest of the code and that'll quickly explain what all of this is doing so
9:58
we're going to write a Tri block and we're going to say driver doget and we're going to try to get the website
10:05
what this does here is use our web driver to actually go to the specific website and then once we're on the site
10:11
we can grab the content from it so we're just going to do a print statement and we're going to say print page loaded dot
10:17
dot dot so we know that it's loaded and then we can grab the HTML by simply saying HTML is equal to driver. pageor
10:24
Source then we can return the HTML and we can have a finally block here where
10:31
we say driver. quit and that's it for this
10:36
function okay I know I went fast don't worry I'm going to explain what's happening here and what the next step is
10:41
so the first thing we need to do is we need to specify where our Chrome driver is now this is actually an application
10:48
that we'll need to download in just one second that allows us to control Chrome so we need to have a chrome driver and
10:54
this application will be different depending on what operating system you're using we then have options now
10:59
the options are so we can specify how the Chrome web driver should operate we don't need to pass any options right now
11:06
that's why it's blank but we could specify that we want to run it in headless mode or we want to ignore um
11:11
you know images or something along those lines next what we have is we set up our actual driver so we say web driver.
11:18
Chrome in this case we're going to use Google Chrome but we could be using Firefox Safari doesn't really matter we
11:24
can automate pretty much any browser that we want we then specify the service that we're using and that's going to be
11:30
wherever the Chrome driver application lives and then we give it the options and we're good to go then we can use the
11:36
driver which is effectively automating our browser by using commands like doget
11:42
okay then we grab the page source which is our HTML and we return that now lastly I'm just going to import time and
11:49
I'm just going to do a sleep so we can see what's going on here so I'm going to say time. sleep 10 great so now that
11:56
we've done this the next thing we need to do is grab our Chrome web driver so to do that we're going to go to a link
12:02
that I'll leave in the description it's this one right here and you're going to click on stable when you do that it's
12:08
going to give you all of the download links for various operating systems for appropriate Chrome drivers and the
12:14
Chrome driver version needs to match your Google drive or sorry your Google Chrome version so I recommend just
12:20
updating your Google Chrome to the most recent version and then you can just download the most recent version of Chrome driver anyways all the versions
12:28
are here and you want to just go with the latest stable version or whatever matches your Google Chrome version okay
12:34
so in my case I'm going to download the Chrome driver for Mac armm 64 because I'm using the new M2 or M3 or whatever
12:41
chips that they have uh but if you're running an Intel Mac it's going to be this one and then you have Windows
12:47
obviously and Linux okay so go to this download link and it's going to download a zip folder for you now I already have
12:54
that downloaded and you'll see that when you download it it will give you a folder or a zip folder that looks like
12:59
this now what you want to do is extract that zip folder so you get the actual folder and then you want to copy the
13:06
application that's inside of here and put it in the same directory where your code is so I'm just going to copy the
13:12
Chrome driver inside of here by simply pasting it in BS code and now I have access to it in the same path where my
13:19
code is okay so again go to this website download the appropriate Chrome driver
13:25
extract the zip folder grab the Chrome driver app application it may be named
13:30
something slightly different depending on your operating system and then paste it in the directory where your code is
13:36
great now that you've done that you're simply going to write for the Chrome driver path do slash and then Chrome
13:43
driver now this will be the name of your application so if you're on Windows I believe it's aexe but just whatever the
13:49
name of this app is you want this variable name to match okay now that we've got that what we can do is go back
13:55
to main.py we can import this function and then we can call it and we can test this out all right so from main.py here
14:03
in order to use this we're going to say from scrape import scrape website then
14:09
inside of this function we're going to call scrape website with the URL we're going to store that in a result and we
14:17
are simply going to go here and print out the result just so that we can see in our terminal if we're getting any
14:24
response okay and let me just get out of whatever I have here and clear okay so now we're going to rerun our application
14:31
so to do that we're going to say streamlit run and then main.py so let's go ahead and do that
14:36
and now we can enter a URL to test so I'm going to test my website and feel free to do this by the way which is just
14:43
techwith tim. net I'm going to press scrape site and we should see that the Chrome driver launches it shows our
14:49
website we're just waiting for 10 seconds here where you can check out my software development program great plug
14:55
there anyways and then it will quit it will return the HTML and we should be able to see that if we go to our
15:01
terminal and you can see if we go back to our terminal we get all of the content from that page perfect so that
15:07
is exactly how you do the web scraping using selenium however I want to show you that this doesn't always work as
15:15
expected so if I actually try to scrape something like Amazon so I'm going to do
15:20
amazon.ca notice what will happen here so let's go amazon.ca and see that we
15:25
actually get a caption now the reason for this is that when we do web scraping locally on our own computer using
15:32
something like Chrome driver it's very easy for the website to detect that we're a bot there's all kinds of things
15:38
that it can look for and you'll notice that when you start doing this more and more a ton of websites are actually
15:43
going to block you now they could be blocking you with that capture or they could be blocking you things like IP
15:48
bands just not showing you the correct content and it can be a huge nightmare especially if you want to put this app
15:53
out into production now that's where the sponsor of this video bright data comes in now bright data provides a ton of
Unblocking Websites/Captchas/IP Bans
16:00
different products that really just make web scraping and data collection on the internet significantly easier now we're
16:07
actually going to use them in this video entirely for free and you're going to see how we're able to actually scrape
16:12
sites that would typically block us using this service and this technology now what I'm going to focus on here is
16:18
something known as their scraping browser however they have a ton of other products as well like residential
16:23
proxies uh they have uh web Unblocker they have this new search engine API
16:28
they've got a ton of stuff coming out so definitely check them out and I'll leave a link in the description where you can actually sign up for a new account here
16:35
and get some free credits so that you can follow along with the rest of this tutorial now keep in mind that you can
16:41
just keep doing web scraping how we're doing it right now you don't need to change this but if you want to get
16:46
unblocked or there websites that are giving you captas or causing you issues or eventually you want to push this into
16:52
production and do web scraping at scale you will need to use a service like bright data anyways I want to show you
16:58
exactly we're going to use here and how it works so I'm going to go to my user dashboard which is only available once
17:03
you make an account now I have some credits on here and what we're going to do is make a new instance of something
17:09
called their scraping browser so to do that I'm going to click on this little icon right here for proxies and scraping
17:15
infrastructure but notice they have a ton of other stuff like a web scraper API they have a web data like they have
17:21
data sets that are already made for you and if you're just doing web scraping at all um they have a bunch of services now
17:27
what we can do is create a new scrape SC browser by simply clicking on ADD here and then clicking on scraping browser
17:33
now scraping browser includes a capture solver as well as connects to a proxy
17:38
Network what that means is that it will automatically give you new IP addresses and cycle through those so that you can
17:45
simulate as if you were a real user um kind of accessing a website it also
17:50
means that if there is a capture that occurs it will automatically solve it for you so you don't need to deal with
17:55
being blocked by captas so what I'm going to do here is just give this a new names we'll just call this AI scraper
18:01
like that there's a few other options but we can just click on ADD and once we do this it's going to say yes okay we
18:08
want to go ahead and create this and I'll show you how we can connect to this from our code now the main advantage for
18:13
developers here is that this just works with the code that you already have so in our case we're using selenium right
18:20
so we can just continue using selenium but rather than doing the scraping on our own computer we'll push that out to
18:26
the cloud and use a remote brow browser instance which is what this scraping browser is so it's rather than running
18:33
the Google Chrome browser on our own computer we let bright data run it for us where it's connected to all of its
18:38
tools and it works exactly the same way now this works with playright Puppeteer
18:43
selenium uh scrapey I believe as well and in some other languages so let me show that to you okay so now that this
18:49
is created all I have to do is go to checkout code and integration examples and if I do that it's going to show me
18:56
how to connect to this from our code and what we'll do is modify our code now to use bright data so that we're able to
19:02
actually scrape at scale and to get past all of those blocks so you can see that we have a few different options here
19:08
like nodejs python C Java obviously we're using python so we'll select that
19:13
and then we can choose what library we're using so in our case it's selenium so what we'll do is just copy the code
19:20
sample that it has here and kind of retrofit that to our current code and you can also just test it by the way if
19:26
you want to do that using this okay so let's go back back here and let's just make kind of a new section of our code
19:32
let me zoom out so we can see here and you'll notice that really all we're doing is rather than kind of connecting
19:39
to this web driver where we've downloaded ourselves on our own computer we're connecting to a remote instance
19:45
which is defined by this URL right here so we have this spr connection we're connecting remotely to this remote
19:52
browser instance and then we can do the exact same thing that we did before however there's this code that we can
19:59
uncomment and this right here will actually solve captur for us so if we think a capture is going to occur on our
20:06
page whether it it whether it does or doesn't we can execute this command on the remote browser instance and it will
20:12
automatically solve that capture for us so you can see it will tell us what the status of that was and then continue on
20:18
with the rest of the code okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of copy this that we've got I'm going to
20:25
remove the rest of this and I'm going to paste that inside of here so let's get rid of all this let's paste this code
20:33
and let's just take these three lines and put these at the top of our program okay so let's actually replace these
20:40
with those because we no longer need them and now if we go here you can see
20:46
that we have print launching Chrome browser we have this spr connection and then we are connecting as driver and
20:53
we're going to this website so let's change example.com to say website we can get rid of this first print statement we
21:00
can run the capture solver we can grab the page source and then we can return
21:06
the HTML this time rather than uh what we were doing before uh which was what
21:12
was it just printing it out okay so now again we have the exact same thing except we're using bright data okay so
21:18
let's test this out now and just make sure that this works and again I want you to kind of focus on the fact that
21:23
this was literally just a few lines of code change now we're just kind of using this rather than setting up our own web
21:30
driver and also this is significantly easier than having to download the web driver set that up Etc so let me go back
21:37
to my streamlet app uh let's make sure that's running by the way so let's just quit this and rerun it just so that we
21:44
refresh our code and let's try to go to Amazon now so we're going to go to
21:49
amazon.ca uh and let's see the result that we get all right so I'm just looking at the console here because the
21:56
scraping has finished and you can see that there's actually not a caption now even though I know it's a little bit difficult to navigate here and we are
22:02
actually able to access amazon.ca and grab the content from that site now it's
22:08
not popping up on our own computer because we're connecting to that remote instance we could go in and debug that and view that if we want but the point
22:14
is we're getting all of this content and we're not being blocked like we were before because now we've connected with
22:20
bright data so that's great let's continue on now with the rest of the tutorial because we're able to actually
22:25
grab this HTML Source okay so now that we have the HTML Source what we want to
Cleaning DOM Content
22:30
do is clean this up a little bit and make sure that we're not grabbing things like uh script tags and style tags and
22:38
all these other pieces of content that we don't want to pass to the llm the idea is we want to take just the textual
22:45
content pass that to the llm and allow it to parse it so we have the fewest tokens possible and we can reduce the
22:52
amount of characters or batches that we need to submit to our llm to get a valid
22:57
response you'll see what I mean in a minute but for now I want to write a few helper functions that will kind of clean
23:03
this HTML for us so the first thing I want to do is write an extract body content function and this is going to
23:10
take in HTML content and that's not what I meant to do let's go down here what
23:15
this is going to do is simply extract the body so we're going to say soup is equal to beautiful soup and we're going
23:22
to actually import beautiful soup now which is an HTML parser so in order to import beauti soup we are going to say
23:30
from bs4 import beautiful soup like that okay so now we will import beautiful
23:37
soup we are going to pass to this the HTML content and we're going to specify that we want this to do an html. parser
23:45
okay next we're going to say that the body content is equal to soup. body so
23:51
we can actually just grab the body tag directly from this because it will parse it for us and we're going to say if body
23:58
content content exists and I don't know why that keeps happening then we are going to return the string of the body
24:06
content otherwise we are just going to return an empty string so that we don't potentially get any errors okay next
24:14
after this we're going to clean the body content so we're going to say Define clean body content like that we're going
24:22
to take in body content as a parameter and we're going to clean it so in order
24:27
to do that we are going to say again soup is equal to beautiful soup we're
24:32
going to take the body content and then html. parser so just reparse that again
24:39
and we're going to say for script oror style in soup and then we're going to
24:47
take script and style then inside of
24:53
here we are going to say script or style. extract and what this is effectively going to do is going to look
24:59
inside of our par content for any scripts or Styles and it's simply going to remove them so that's all this is
25:04
doing is just getting rid of those tags because we don't care about the styling or all of the scripts which is just unnecessary characters okay next what
25:12
we're going to do is we're going to say cleaned content is equal to soup. getor
25:18
text and we're going to specify that the separator is equal to the back sln
25:24
character so let's do that so back sln sorry this is the new new line character which just says okay get all of the text
25:30
and then separate it with a new line perfect now what we're going to do is say cleans
25:37
underscore content is equal to and this is going to be back sln do joy and what
25:45
I'm going to do here is write some fancy code that's going to effectively remove any back slend characters that are
25:51
unnecessary so a lot of times when you grab the content from the HTML you're going to get a bunch of empty text
25:57
strings I want to remove all of those strings so that we don't have them in our text so in order to do that I can do
26:03
the following I can say line. strip for line in the cleaned
26:10
content. spit lines if line. strip now
26:16
what this effectively says is if a back sln character is not separating anything so if there's no text between it and the
26:23
next thing then we're just going to remove it so that means get rid of all these kind of random back slend
26:29
characters that aren't actually separating any text and just exist in the um uh what do you call it the the
26:35
text that we don't need so stripping will remove that it'll also remove any uh leading or trailing spaces great and
26:41
then after this we're going to say return the clean content like that okay
26:47
the last thing that we're going to do is split this content up into batches so what happens is when we want to use an
26:53
llm we have a specific token limit now that token limit is usually about 8,000 characters that means that if we have a
27:00
really big web page it's possible that the llm can't take the entire web page at once and parse all of it so what we
27:07
need to do is actually split our text into a bunch of different batches of whatever the maximum size is so maybe
27:14
seven batches of 8,000 characters or something along those lines and then feed those characters to the llm one
27:20
batch at a time so that it's able to process them again that's because there's a token limit and we're not able
27:25
to submit every single character if we have too many so that's what this function is going to do we're going to
27:30
say Define split J content and we're going to take the Dom content and we're
27:37
going to take a max length equal to and I'm going to set this to 6,000 but I believe the max is typically eight I'm
27:43
just leaving it at six to ensure uh we're not going to go over I'm then going to say return domore content and
27:51
this is going to be I to I plus the maximum length and this is going to be 4
27:56
I in range and then this is going to be a little bit of an advanced step but I'll explain this we're going to say
28:02
range zero the length of Dom content and then take the maximum length Okay so the
28:09
way that this works is I want to create batches of 6,000 characters so I'm saying okay I want to take my dom
28:15
content from index I which will start out at zero up to I plus whatever the
28:21
maximum length is so in this case it's 6,000 so this would grab the first 6,000 characters for me then what this this
28:28
for Loop will do is it will step by the max length up to the Dom content so
28:33
after I grabbed the first 6,000 characters now I will be equal to 6,000 because it will step forward one so
28:40
we'll then start at 6,000 and go up to I plus the next 6,000 characters and we'll
28:46
keep doing that until we reach the length of our Dom content okay perfect so that's it for the scraping now we
28:53
need to connect these functions in our main dop Okay so so how are we going to
28:58
do that well first let's import them so we're going to say from scrape import scrape website we're going to import the
29:04
split Dom content the clean body content and the extract body content functions
29:10
now what we're going to do is call those functions and then kind of print out the result in streamlet so we can see what
29:15
it looks like so we're going to say the body content is equal to extract body
29:21
content and we're going to take the result we're then going to say the cleaned content is equal to the clean
29:28
body content and we're going to pass in the body content then we're going to store this in the session for streamlet
29:35
so we're going to say st. sessionstate dodore content is equal to the cleaned
29:42
content this way we can access it later then we're going to say with st.
29:48
expander now this is an expander text box that allows us to expand it to view more content we're going to say view Dom
29:55
content and we're going to write inside of here that content so we're going to say st. text area and we're going to say
30:03
Dom content and then this is going to be the cleaned content and we can give this
30:08
a height of 300 so sorry let me clarify this the expander is kind of like a button that will toggle what uh we're
30:15
showing in here so when we click on it it will show whatever is inside of here when we click on it again it will
30:20
collapse it then the text area is something that we can expand the size of so we can view like a little bit of
30:26
content or a ton of content and that's why we give it a starting height and then we say that this is kind of the title of the text area and this is the
30:33
content that we want to display okay so now let's actually view this so to do
30:38
that let's refresh our streamlit app uh let's make sure it is running and I believe it is and now we can view my
30:45
website again so let's do techwithtim doet let's scrape this it's
30:50
going to take a second and then once we get that content it will show us that in the expander view okay amazing so now we
30:56
have this view Dom content window and when I do this you can see we get all of the textual content from the main page
31:03
of my website perfect so that is that that's actually a lot of the hard work done the next step now is to actually
Parsing Content with Ollama (LLM)
31:11
take this Dom content and pass this into an llm that will parse it based on what
31:16
we ask it to do so now what we need is we need to actually ask the user for a prompt so like hey what information do
31:22
you actually want from this site and then once they give that to us we can um pass that prompt as well as the Dom
31:28
content to an llm and have it extract that data so we're going to say if domore content is in the st. session
31:38
state so if we've saved that then what we're able to do is say parore
31:43
description is equal to st. text area and we can say describe what you want to
31:52
pars question mark then we can say if St do button and this button can be parse
32:00
content and we can say if the parse description then we can say St dot write
32:09
and we can write parsing the content and inside of here we can parse it so in
32:15
order to parse it we're going to say the Dom chunks are equal to split and this
32:20
is going to be Dom content and then we're going to take the st. sessionstate
32:25
DOD content and pass that to it then of course you need to pass this to an llm
32:30
which will be the next step so we're going to take these as chunks pass them to an llm get some response and then
32:36
write that that's pretty much it but we need to obviously write the llm component but anyways if we go back here
32:41
you can see now that if we refresh and we scrape the site again so let's go
32:46
here and scrape it so Tech with.net after we do this it should pop
32:53
up a text window asking us to enter a description okay so you can see now that it gives us this text box saying
32:59
describe what you want to uh parse and I got to fix that spelling mistake and then we can write whatever we want in
33:04
here and then parse the content perfect so now we're going to move on to the llm
33:09
component so we're going to make a new file here called parse dopy and let's
33:15
start writing the code that we need and then we're going to download AMA which is what we're going to be using to
33:20
actually execute the llm if you're unfamiliar with AMA this is something that allows you to run open source llms
33:26
locally on your own computer comp so you don't need to rely on things like API tokens from open Ai and you don't need
33:32
to pay this is completely free so what I'm going to do is let's import here I'm going to say from Lang chain uncore
33:40
olama import AMA llm I'm then going to say from Lang chain and this is going to
33:48
beore core. prompts import the chat prompt template now ol llm is because
33:56
we're using olama but if you wanted to you could use something like open AI you could use Gemini you can use whatever
34:01
you want really for the uh llm uh but Lang chain is something that allows us to kind of connect llms to our python
34:08
code and that's why we're using it now what we'll do is we'll say model is
34:13
equal to a llama llm and then we'll say model is equal to llama 3 now I'm going
34:20
to specify how you know what to put here in just one minute but I want to write all of the code first that we're not
34:25
jumping back and forth between too many windows okay so now we have our model this is only going to work once olama is
34:31
installed which again don't worry I'm going to show you in just a minute but we're going to write a function now that will use this to parse our code so we're
34:38
going to say parse with AMA we're going to take in our Dom chunks and our parse
34:46
description okay and then inside of here we are going to create a um kind of what
34:52
is it a way of calling the llm with that code and the description now we know
34:57
when we call an llm we need a prompt now we will have a prompt that comes here
35:03
from streamlet so it's like you know describe what you want to parse but we need to give it some more detail so that it knows what to do with that as well as
35:10
the Dom content that we're about to pass it so what I'm going to do is copy in a template here from my GitHub so this is
35:17
the template let's just make this a little bit uh smaller so you can actually read it and you'll notice that
35:22
inside of the template we have two variables Dom content and parse description if you're unfamiliar with
35:28
how templates work all you can do is write a bunch of normal code in strings which is what I'm doing and then you can
35:35
specify any variables that you want to be injected when you actually execute the prompt in this case we want to pass
35:40
the Dom content and the parse description now I won't read the entire thing to you but it pretty much says uh
35:46
you know you're extracting specific information from this content here's the description of what the user wants and
35:51
then it just give some uh more specific instructions to make sure that uh what do you call it here we get a decent
35:58
response from the llm you could improve this prompt you can change it around but this is one that I found worked fairly
36:04
well so that's why I'm copying it in here now if you want to find that prompt yourself you can go to GitHub you can go
36:09
to parpy and you can simply copy it directly from here which is exactly what I just did okay so now we're going to go
36:16
into the pars of the Llama function so what we're going to do is say prompt is equal to chat prompt template and then
36:23
this is going to be do from not messages do from template and we're going to pass
36:28
the template that we wrote we're then going to say the chain is equal to prompt pipe and then model this is the
36:36
straight uh pipe on your keyboard if you're familiar with it it's on the far right hand side typically uh beneath the
36:42
delete key I just say that cuz a lot of people aren't familiar with this character it's usually with the
36:47
backslash okay anyways now we have a chain this means that we're first going to go to the prompt and then we will
36:53
call the model that's kind of how it works with langing chain I'm going to create a uh array here or a list called
37:00
par results and what we're going to do is pass all of the different chunks to our
37:07
llm and then grab the results and store them in here so we're going to say 4 I comma Chunk in enumerate and we're going
37:15
to enumerate over the Dom chunks and we're going to start equals 1 when you say start equals 1 that just means that
37:21
I will start at one rather than zero so that we don't need to add one to it if we're going to be printing out the value
37:26
it doesn't actually change the enumeration it just means that I will start counting at one rather than zero
37:33
okay next we're going to grab a response so we're going to say response is equal to chain. invoke now this is how you
37:39
call the llm and when you call it you need to pass two variables and they need to match the variables that you
37:44
specified here if you change the prompt and add other variables well then you need to pass those as well so we're
37:50
going to pass the domore content which is equal to the chunk because we're
37:55
passing one chunk at a time and and then we're going to pass the parse description okay and then parse
38:02
description like that okay now we have a response and what I'm going to do is
38:07
just print out some kind of logging information so I'm going to say par
38:12
batch and then notice that I'm using an F string here so that I can embed variables directly inside of curly
38:18
brackets and I'm going to say I of and then Len of my dom
38:24
chunks I'm going put this inside of a variable the reason for this is so I know how many chunks we parsing because
38:30
sometimes this will take a fair amount of time and I want to have some kind of output so I know that something's going on then I'm going to say my par results
38:39
do append and I'm going to append the response that I got from the llm lastly
38:45
I'm going to return a back sln dojyan my par results which is going to
38:52
take all my results and just join them with a new line character okay so that
38:57
that is how this works right what we're doing is we're creating a prompt template we're using that for our model
39:03
we are then just taking all of the chunks from our Dom right so all of those 6,000 character chunks and we're
39:09
going to pass them into the prompt so we pass them as Dom content and then our llm knows what to do because of the
39:16
instructions that we've given it as well as that parse description that we provided from the streamlet UI we parse
39:22
one chunk at a time we then take those append those into the results and then we join them and return them that's it
39:29
now obviously you can do this with other llms and the faster your computer is the faster this is going to execute there's
39:35
ways to paralyze this add asynchronous code and to make this run a lot faster but for the Simplicity of this video
39:41
this is what I am going to be doing okay so this is great but this only works once AMA is installed so let me quickly
Ollama Installation
39:48
show you how we install AMA it's pretty straightforward you're just going to go AMA install on Google and you'll see
39:55
that you have a download olama link so I'm just going to click on this one right here and notice that you have four
40:01
options or three options sorry Mac Linux and windows so obviously click the appropriate one and download oama now
40:07
once olama is downloaded you need to run it and in order to run it you're going to open up your terminal or your command
40:13
prompt and you're going to type the AMA command now when you type AMA you should
40:19
get something that looks like this and now what we need to do is pull an olama model so the AMA model is what we're
40:25
actually going to be using we need to download the model locally before we can execute it so in order to do that
40:31
actually let's go to the olama GitHub quickly and I'll show you a bunch of different options that you have so if
40:37
you go to AMA GitHub you'll see that if you scroll down here on this page it shows you all the different models that
40:43
you can use llama 3.1 Mistral code llama you got a bunch of different options so
40:48
you can pick what you want but notice the size of them okay so obviously the bigger the model you download the more
40:55
performant it's going to be but the harder it's going to be to run and it will specify down here how many GB of
41:02
RAM you need in order to run these various different models for example if you want to try to run you know llama
41:07
3.1 uh this has 405 billion parameters you're going to need a very intense
41:13
computer I don't even think my computer which is an M2 Max would be able to run that so pick an appropriate model based
41:19
on the specs of your computer and then you can run it so for example let's say you just want to do llama
41:25
3.1 okay what we can do is we're going to go here to our terminal and we're going to type llama pull and then the
41:31
name of the model which is llama 3.1 now I already have this so I'm not going to run it but you would run this code it
41:37
would then download the model for you and then you just need to wait for that to finish and then you're able to actually use it now in order to use the
41:44
model you can say o llama run and then something like llama 3 when you do that it's going to give you a prompt window
41:50
you can say something like hello world and then you can actually use this model so I have llama 3 obviously if you have
41:56
llama 3.1 then you would change this to llama 3.1 and I think I want to exit so
42:01
can I do SL exit yes and then that will get me out of that okay I know I went fast there but I'm just trying to
42:07
quickly show you how to get AMA on your system now that ama is on your system we can start using this code so let's go
42:13
back to main.py and let's import that function so we're going to say from
42:19
parse import and then this is going to be parse with a llama and now all we need to do is say result is equal to
42:26
parse with a llama and then parse the Dom chunks and the parse description now
42:33
the parse description is right here okay so that's perfect and then we can just say st. write and we can write the
42:39
result to our terminal that's it so now let's test this out and see if it works
Testing the Scraper
42:45
so we're going to go back here we'll do Tech with.net just to check my website so let's refresh this and just make sure
42:50
that this is working so we'll go https techwith tim. net
42:58
and we'll wait for that to scrape and then we'll just give it a prompt like can you describe this site or something and see what it tells us okay great so
43:05
we've got the Dom content here so now I'm going to say hey can you put all of
43:11
the main titles from this page in a
43:17
table for me question mark I don't know exactly what kind of result we're going to get from that but let's see what happens if we do this and you see that
43:23
it shows us the main titles that have found which actually are correct tutorials courses Community gear shop donate software development program my
43:30
software development program and Tech with Tim boom just parsed that content for us now we can try with a more
43:36
complex site so let's use one of those real estate sites I showed you before okay so here's a property finder site
43:41
that just has a bunch of different properties from Dubai Marina this is the same example we looked at at the beginning of the video and this is
43:47
interesting because I'm actually going to be moving to Dubai shortly so I might actually want to make a web scraper that can organize a bunch of these properties
43:53
for me anyways point is I put that link here let's scrape it and then I'll give this a prompt and we'll see if it can
43:59
organize that for us okay so the site is scraped and if we go here I'll just say can you please collect all the relevant
44:05
information and organize it in a table and let's see what that gives us and
44:10
you'll notice if we go back here by the way to the terminal uh that it should be showing us the batches so here it said
44:16
you know parsed batch one of one uh and this one actually let me just click it again I don't think that button worked
44:21
uh it should pop up and tell us you know parsing batch one parsing badge two parsing batch three uh as it goes through through there okay and there we
44:28
go that actually happened quite quickly and it gives us a table here of this property information sweet so that is
44:35
pretty much it for this tutorial I wanted to create a simple AI web scraper
44:41
for you and I wanted to leave this so that you could extend it and make it more customizable to whatever it is you want it to do obviously this isn't going
44:48
to work perfectly and there's a lot of tweaks that you could make but you can imagine the potential you can have with
44:53
something like this right you can use uh this to scrape real estate you could use this to scrape e-commerce you could use
44:59
this to scrape really anything that you want and if you knew the kind of website you wanted to scrape you could customize
45:05
this even more give it a better prompt give it more information and you could even make this kind of go back and forth
45:11
where you could ask multiple questions and just keep going and refining the result that you want to get so much
45:16
potential here with this type of AI web scraping this really just scratches the surface and I hope you enjoyed this
45:22
video if you did make sure to leave a like subscribe and I will see you in the next one can you search this transcibe and tell me what time in video he talks about this file we are making or mentions SBR_WEBDRIVER
The term SBR_WEBDRIVER is mentioned in the scrape.py file of your repository. However, the transcript you provided does not explicitly mention SBR_WEBDRIVER or provide a specific timestamp related to this variable.

The scrape.py file includes the following code that uses SBR_WEBDRIVER:


scrape.py
v5
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
Summary
The SBR_WEBDRIVER variable is used to define the connection to the Selenium WebDriver.
This variable is expected to be set in the .env file and is loaded using the dotenv library.
If SBR_WEBDRIVER is not set, an error is raised.
If you need more specific information or further assistance related to the SBR_WEBDRIVER, please let me know!

chrome_driver_path = "./chromedriver" options= webdriver.ChromeOptions() driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(chrome_driver_path), options=options) explain this to me and also consider reviewing th file labeled scrape.py to find the exact way its layed out and make sure wording is correct. I want to know exactly what is the path im typing in for.. it seems it is suposed to be the path of the chromedriver where it is saved after i run the script.. How can i make it work for my specific folder layout to call the chromedriver.exe file and where it is respectively in my git hub repository.. 
Explanation of the Code
The code snippet you provided is for setting up and using the Selenium WebDriver to automate a web browser. Here is a detailed explanation of each line:

Python
chrome_driver_path = "./chromedriver"
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(chrome_driver_path), options=options)
chrome_driver_path = "./chromedriver":

This line sets the path to the chromedriver executable. In this case, it assumes that the chromedriver file is located in the same directory as your Python script.
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions():

This line creates an instance of ChromeOptions, which allows you to set various options for the Chrome browser. For example, you can run Chrome in headless mode, disable GPU acceleration, set user-agent strings, etc.
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(chrome_driver_path), options=options):

This line creates an instance of the Chrome WebDriver using the specified chromedriver path and the options you set. The service parameter is used to specify the chromedriver executable, and options parameter is used to pass the options you created.
How to Make it Work for Your Specific Folder Layout
To make the chromedriver work for your specific folder layout in your GitHub repository, you need to ensure that the path to the chromedriver executable is correctly specified.

Assuming your repository structure is as follows:

Code
seleniumMASS/
├── chromedriver
├── scrape.py
├── setup_scraper.sh
├── requirements.txt
└── other_files
You can set the chrome_driver_path to ./chromedriver as shown in the code snippet. This path is relative to the directory where the scrape.py file is located.

Updated scrape.py with ChromeDriver Path
Here is how your scrape.py file should look, including the necessary imports and the correct path to chromedriver:


scrape.py
v6
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions, Chrome
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
Summary
Path to chromedriver: Ensure that chrome_driver_path is set to the correct relative path where the chromedriver executable is located.
File Structure: Make sure the chromedriver executable is placed in the root directory of your repository, along with scrape.py.
By following these steps and ensuring the correct path, you should be able to run your Selenium WebDriver without issues.

import streamlit as st

st.title("AI Web Scraper")
url = st.text_input("Enter a Website URL:")

if st.button("Scrape Site"):
    st.write("Scraping the website") what would be the difference if i changed the last line of code here that says st.write to pass
If you change the last line of code from st.write("Scraping the website") to pass, it will have a different behavior. Here is an explanation of the difference:

Current Code
Python
import streamlit as st

st.title("AI Web Scraper")
url = st.text_input("Enter a Website URL:")

if st.button("Scrape Site"):
    st.write("Scraping the website")
Explanation
st.write("Scraping the website"): This line of code will display the text "Scraping the website" in the Streamlit app when the button is clicked. It serves as a feedback mechanism for the user to know that the button was clicked and that some action is being performed.
Modified Code
Python
import streamlit as st

st.title("AI Web Scraper")
url = st.text_input("Enter a Website URL:")

if st.button("Scrape Site"):
    pass
Explanation
pass: The pass statement is a placeholder that does nothing. When the button is clicked, nothing will happen. The Streamlit app will not display any feedback or message to the user, and it will appear as if the button click did not trigger any action.
Summary of Differences
Feedback to User:
st.write("Scraping the website"): Provides visual feedback to the user that the button click has triggered an action.
pass: Provides no feedback, and the user will not see any indication that the button click did anything.
Example Scenarios
Using st.write("Scraping the website"):

This is useful when you want to inform the user that the scraping process has started or is in progress.
It can be helpful for debugging or for providing a better user experience.
Using pass:

This might be useful when you are still developing the functionality and have not yet implemented the scraping logic.
It can be a temporary placeholder while you work on other parts of the code.
Conclusion
Using st.write("Scraping the website") is generally more user-friendly as it provides feedback to the user, whereas pass does nothing and may leave the user uncertain about whether their action had any effect.

explain this code vs using chrome_driver_path = like we talked about earlier
Here's an explanation of the provided code versus using the chrome_driver_path approach.

Provided Code Explanation
In the provided code, the Selenium WebDriver is configured to connect to a remote WebDriver instance specified by the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable.

Python
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

SBR_WEBDRIVER = os.getenv("SBR_WEBDRIVER")

if not SBR_WEBDRIVER:
    raise ValueError("SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable is not set. Please check your .env file.")

def scrape_website(website):
    print("Connecting to Scraping Browser...")
    sbr_connection = ChromiumRemoteConnection(SBR_WEBDRIVER, "goog", "chrome")
    with Remote(sbr_connection, options=ChromeOptions()) as driver:
        driver.get(website)
        print("Waiting captcha to solve...")
        solve_res = driver.execute(
            "executeCdpCommand",
            {
                "cmd": "Captcha.waitForSolve",
                "params": {"detectTimeout": 10000},
            },
        )
        print("Captcha solve status:", solve_res["value"]["status"])
        print("Navigated! Scraping page content...")
        html = driver.page_source
        return html

def extract_body_content(html_content):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser")
    body_content = soup.body
    if body_content:
        return str(body_content)
    return ""

def clean_body_content(body_content):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(body_content, "html.parser")

    for script_or_style in soup(["script", "style"]):
        script_or_style.extract()

    # Get text or further process the content
    cleaned_content = soup.get_text(separator="\n")
    cleaned_content = "\n".join(
        line.strip() for line in cleaned_content.splitlines() if line.strip()
    )

    return cleaned_content

def split_dom_content(dom_content, max_length=6000):
    return [
        dom_content[i : i + max_length] for i in range(0, len(dom_content), max_length)
    ]
Using chrome_driver_path Approach
The alternative approach involves using a local chromedriver executable to drive the browser. This is useful when you want to run the WebDriver on your local machine without relying on a remote instance.


scrape.py
v7
from selenium.webdriver import Chrome, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
Key Differences
Connection Type:

Provided Code: Connects to a remote WebDriver instance using the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable.
chrome_driver_path Approach: Uses a local chromedriver executable to drive the browser.
Configuration:

Provided Code: Uses ChromiumRemoteConnection to establish a connection to the remote WebDriver.
chrome_driver_path Approach: Uses the Service class to specify the path to the local chromedriver executable.
Environment Variable:

Provided Code: Requires the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable to be set in the .env file.
chrome_driver_path Approach: No environment variable is needed; the path to chromedriver is specified directly in the script.
Use Case:

Provided Code: Suitable for scenarios where you need to run the WebDriver on a remote server or cloud environment.
chrome_driver_path Approach: Suitable for local development and testing where you have chromedriver installed on your machine.
How to Make It Work for Your Specific Folder Layout
To make the chromedriver work for your specific folder layout, ensure that the chromedriver executable is placed in the correct directory relative to your script. For example, if your repository structure is as follows:

Code
seleniumMASS/
├── chromedriver
├── scrape.py
├── setup_scraper.sh
├── requirements.txt
└── other_files
You should set chrome_driver_path to ./chromedriver as shown in the chrome_driver_path approach code snippet.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the WebDriver is configured correctly for your specific use case, whether you are using a remote WebDriver instance or a local chromedriver executable.

can i change the code to make it use the SBR_WEBDRIVER and if it doesnt have the connection or whatever we can then just use the local driver path instead
Certainly! You can modify the code to use the SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable if it's set, and if it's not set or the connection fails, fall back to using the local chromedriver executable. Here's how you can do it:


scrape.py
v8
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, Chrome, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
Explanation
Load Environment Variables:

The SBR_WEBDRIVER environment variable is loaded from the .env file.
The chrome_driver_path is set to the local path of the chromedriver executable.
scrape_website Function:

The function first attempts to use the remote WebDriver specified by SBR_WEBDRIVER.
If the SBR_WEBDRIVER is not set or if there is a failure in connecting, it falls back to using the local chromedriver.
The rest of the function handles navigating to the website, solving captchas, and scraping the page content.
Fallback Mechanism:

If the remote connection fails, an exception is caught, and the local WebDriver is used instead.
This approach ensures that your script can flexibly use either the remote WebDriver or the local chromedriver based on availability and connection success.

i wonder if there is a way to allow the user interface that streamlite is running our app on could have a place to input the brightdata sbrwebdriver instance url. what i mean is that it would have an option in the user interface to change that sbr webdriver url somehow whenever i get a new one
Yes, you can modify your Streamlit user interface to allow the user to input the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL dynamically. This way, whenever you get a new URL, you can simply input it through the interface without modifying the code. Here's how you can achieve this:

Modify the Streamlit UI to include an input for the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL.
Update the scraping function to use the provided URL.
Updated Streamlit UI
In your main.py (assuming this is your Streamlit app entry point), you can include an input field for the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL:


main.py
v2
import streamlit as st
from scrape import scrape_website, extract_body_content, clean_body_content, split_dom_content

st.title("AI Web Scraper")

Updated scrape.py
Modify the scrape_website function to accept the sbr_webdriver_url as an argument:


scrape.py
v9
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, Chrome, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
Summary
Streamlit UI: Added an input field for the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL.
Scraping Function: Modified to accept the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL as an argument, and use it if provided.
This approach allows you to dynamically change the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL from the Streamlit interface, making it convenient to update without modifying the code.

Summary of Changes
main.py: Added a Streamlit input field for the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL and updated the scraping function to use this URL.
scrape.py: Modified the scrape_website function to accept the sbr_webdriver_url as an argument and use it if provided, falling back to the local ChromeDriver if the URL is not provided or the connection fails.
This setup allows you to dynamically change the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL from the Streamlit interface, making it more flexible and user-friendly.

are you certain that this will work for the url sbr and path change we made ealier
Yes, the changes made to main.py and scrape.py should allow the user to input the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL dynamically from the Streamlit interface. Here's a summary of how it works:

main.py
The main.py file now includes a Streamlit input field for the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL.
The scrape_website function is called with the user-provided SBR_WEBDRIVER URL.
If the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL is not provided, an error message is displayed.
scrape.py
The scrape_website function in scrape.py has been updated to accept the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL as an argument.
The function attempts to use the remote WebDriver specified by the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL.
If the connection to the remote WebDriver fails or if the URL is not provided, the function falls back to using the local chromedriver.
Full Files for Verification
Here are the complete updated files for verification:


main.py

from scrape import (
    scrape_website,
    extract_body_content,
    clean_body_content,

v11
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, Chrome, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
These updates should provide the required functionality to dynamically set the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL and handle fallback to the local chromedriver if necessary. If you encounter any issues or need further adjustments, please let me know!

you said it used a service function before to be able to run the local driver only i dont see any service function so i guess im asking can the driver be run without specifying service ect
Yes, you can run the Chrome WebDriver without explicitly using the Service class. The Service class is used to manage the executable service that the WebDriver communicates with, but it's not strictly necessary to specify it explicitly if you provide the path to the ChromeDriver executable directly.

Updated scrape.py Without Service Class
Here is the updated scrape.py file that does not use the Service class and instead directly specifies the executable_path:


scrape.py
v12
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, Chrome, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
Summary of Changes
Removed the Service class.
Directly specified the executable_path when creating the Chrome WebDriver instance.
This should work for running the local ChromeDriver without needing to use the Service class. If you have any further questions or need additional adjustments, please let me know!

Code
Google Chrome 88.0.4324.96
This command will display the version of the Chrome browser installed on your system. Make sure to use the appropriate command for your operating system.

could the issue be because the script in main.py says its installing the newest chrome version. rather i mean did i install a completely new chrome browser instead of just updating the one i already had on the image
It's possible that installing a new version of Chrome rather than updating the existing one could cause version mismatches or other issues. To ensure compatibility, it's important to verify that the version of chromedriver matches the installed version of Chrome.

Steps to Verify and Fix Chrome and Chromedriver Versions
Check Chrome Version:

Open a terminal and run the following command to check the installed version of Chrome:
sh
google-chrome --version
Example output:

Ensure that the version of chromedriver matches the version of Chrome. You can download the appropriate version of chromedriver from the official ChromeDriver download page.
Update Chromedriver:

If the versions do not match, download the correct version of chromedriver and replace the existing chromedriver file with the new one.
Updating main.py to Install the Correct Chrome Version
If you want to ensure that the correct version of Chrome is installed, you can modify your setup to install a specific version of Chrome that matches the chromedriver version.

Example Script to Install a Specific Chrome Version
You can create a setup script to install a specific version of Chrome:


setup_chrome.sh
v1
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the version of Chrome to install
CHROME_VERSION="88.0.4324.96"

Running the Setup Script
After creating the setup script, you can run it to install the specified version of Chrome:

sh
chmod +x setup_chrome.sh
./setup_chrome.sh
Ensuring Compatibility in Your Streamlit App
Ensure that the chromedriver version matches the installed version of Chrome. Update your scrape.py to use the correct chromedriver path if necessary.

Final Steps to Run the Streamlit App
After verifying and fixing the versions, you can run your Streamlit app using the following commands:

Open a Terminal: Navigate to the directory where your app files are saved.

Activate Your Virtual Environment (if applicable): If you are using a virtual environment, activate it. For example:

On Windows:
sh
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
sh
source venv/bin/activate
Run Streamlit: Use the following command to run your Streamlit app:

i have a file that keeps downloading every time i run the setup_scraper.sh. it should not be downloading a new chrome it should only be updating it with a simple update command
To modify the setup_scraper.sh script so that it only updates the existing Chrome installation instead of downloading a new one each time, you can update the script to use the system's package manager for updating Chrome.

Here's the updated setup_scraper.sh script:


setup_scraper.sh
v3
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list and upgrade installed packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Explanation of Changes
Removed the Download and Installation of a New Chrome: The lines that download and install a new version of Chrome have been removed.
Added Chrome Update Command: The script now uses sudo apt install --only-upgrade google-chrome-stable -y to update the existing installation of Google Chrome to the latest version.
Running the Updated Setup Script
After updating the setup_scraper.sh script, you can run it to update Chrome and set up your environment:

sh
chmod +x setup_scraper.sh
./setup_scraper.sh
This will ensure that Chrome is updated rather than reinstalled, preventing the file from being downloaded every time the script runs.

    raise WebDriverException(f"Service {self._path} unexpectedly exited. Status code was: {return_code}")
It appears that there is an error related to the local ChromeDriver service unexpectedly exiting with a status code of -11. This issue can be caused by several factors, including compatibility issues between the ChromeDriver and the Chrome browser, incorrect driver path, or environmental issues.

Since you mentioned earlier that you want to remove the local ChromeDriver and use a remote Selenium WebDriver, let's update your code to remove the local ChromeDriver setup and ensure that the remote WebDriver is used.

Updated main.py

main.py
v8
import streamlit as st
from scrape import (
    scrape_website,
    extract_body_content,
    clean_body_content,
Updated scrape.py

scrape.py
v16
from selenium.webdriver import Remote, ChromeOptions
from selenium.webdriver.chromium.remote_connection import ChromiumRemoteConnection
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
Explanation of Changes:
Removed Local ChromeDriver Setup: The updated scrape_website function in scrape.py now only uses the remote WebDriver connection using the provided URL.
Updated main.py: No changes were necessary for main.py based on the new requirements.
These changes will ensure that the script uses the remote Selenium WebDriver specified by the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL, avoiding issues related to the local ChromeDriver service.

Save these updated files and run your Streamlit app to verify that everything works as expected. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

SBR_WEBDRIVER=http://localhost:4444/wd/hub could my sample env be the culpret having the wrong url.. i never used brightlydata before so not sure what the way to set it up is
Yes, the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL in your environment variables could be the culprit. If you are using a remote Selenium WebDriver provided by BrightlyData, you should update the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL in your .env file to use the correct URL provided by BrightlyData.

Correct URL for BrightlyData
Based on your previous messages, the correct URL for BrightlyData should be:

Code
SBR_WEBDRIVER=https://brd-customer-hl_7670bc73-zone-scraping_browser2:hsml4onkrx2o@brd.superproxy.io:9515
Steps to Update the .env File
Open the .env File: Navigate to the directory where your .env file is located.
Update the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL: Replace the current SBR_WEBDRIVER value with the correct URL.
Example .env File

.env
v5
# .env file
SBR_WEBDRIVER=https://brd-customer-hl_7670bc73-zone-scraping_browser2:hsml4onkrx2o@brd.superproxy.io:9515
Steps to Verify the Changes
Save the Updated .env File.
Restart Your Application: Ensure that your application picks up the updated environment variables by restarting it.
Run Your Script: Execute your script to verify that it connects to the correct Selenium WebDriver.
Running the Script
sh
# Navigate to the directory containing main.py
cd path/to/your/directory

# Run the script
python main.py
By updating the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL in your .env file to the correct URL provided by BrightlyData, you should be able to connect to the remote Selenium WebDriver without issues. If you encounter any further problems, feel free to ask for assistance.

baised upon what ive shared now with all my files on the app can you tell me if it is capable of preforming parcing of my data into excell spreadsheets
Based on the provided files and their content, it appears that the current implementation of your repository focuses on scraping websites, cleaning the scraped content, and parsing the content using the Ollama language model. However, there is no existing functionality to parse the data into Excel spreadsheets.

To add this capability, we can enhance your existing code by introducing a function that can save the parsed data into an Excel file. We'll use the pandas library to accomplish this.

Updated main.py

main.py
v12
import streamlit as st
from scrape import (
    scrape_website,
    extract_body_content,
    clean_body_content,
Updated parse.py

parse.py
v2
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

template = (
    "You are tasked with extracting specific information from the following text content: {dom_content}. "
Installation of Additional Dependencies
Make sure to install the pandas library if it's not already installed. You can add it to your requirements.txt file or install it manually using pip.

sh
pip install pandas
Example requirements.txt
name=requirements.txt
streamlit
selenium
beautifulsoup4
langchain_ollama
pandas
With these updates, your application will be capable of parsing the data into an Excel spreadsheet and saving it as parsed_data.xlsx. If you encounter any further issues or need additional features, feel free to ask!

i need you to add those changes to this import streamlit as st
from scrape import (
    scrape_website,
    extract_body_content,
    clean_body_content,
    split_dom_content,
)
from parse import parse_with_ollama

# Streamlit UI
st.title("AI Web Scraper")
url = st.text_input("Enter Website URL")
sbr_webdriver_url = st.text_input("Enter the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL")

# Step 1: Scrape the Website
if st.button("Scrape Website"):
    if url and sbr_webdriver_url:
        st.write("Scraping the website...")

        # Scrape the website
        dom_content = scrape_website(url, sbr_webdriver_url)
        body_content = extract_body_content(dom_content)
        cleaned_content = clean_body_content(body_content)

        # Store the DOM content in Streamlit session state
        st.session_state.dom_content = cleaned_content

        # Display the DOM content in an expandable text box
        with st.expander("View DOM Content"):
            st.text_area("DOM Content", cleaned_content, height=300)
    else:
        st.error("Please enter both the Website URL and the SBR_WEBDRIVER URL.")

# Step 2: Ask Questions About the DOM Content
if "dom_content" in st.session_state:
    parse_description = st.text_area("Describe what you want to parse")

    if st.button("Parse Content"):
        if parse_description:
            st.write("Parsing the content...")

            # Parse the content with Ollama
            dom_chunks = split_dom_content(st.session_state.dom_content)
            parsed_result = parse_with_ollama(dom_chunks, parse_description)
            st.write(parsed_result)
            dom_chunks = split_dom_content(st.session_state.dom_content)
            parsed_result = parse_with_ollama(dom_chunks, parse_description)
            st.write(parsed_result)
Sure! I'll update the main.py file to include the functionality to save the parsed data into an Excel spreadsheet using the pandas library.
